IDE Swing Code Generation

In the NetBeans IDE, IDE generated code is in uneditable "guarded blocks."
The IDE creates a private method named "initComponents," which initializes the
various components of the GUI. It also tells the application to "exit on close,"
performs some layout-specific tasks, then packs the components together on the
screen.

Can edit within Property Editor without entering the source code directly.

The Inspector provides a graphical representation of your application's
components.
