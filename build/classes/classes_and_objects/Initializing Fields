Initializing Fields

Fields can be initialized in their delcarations or, if it requires logic, in
the class constructor. Initializing instance variables in the constructor
is preferred.

It is not necessary to declare and initialize fields at the beginning of the
class definition, only before they are used.

To initialize class/static variable is it possible to call a method from the
declaration, a private static method, or use a static code block.

To initialize an instance variable it is possible to call a method from the
declaration, a protected final method, or use a code block without the static
keyword. Instance variables are created AFTER an instance is created. Until
that time, only static class variables are available.
