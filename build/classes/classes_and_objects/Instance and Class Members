Use of the Static Keyword

The "static" keyword is used to create fields and methods that belong to the
class, rather than in instance of the class.

Static (class) Variables

static fields and static methods are associated with the class, rather than
with any object. Any object can change the value of a class variable, but class
variables can also be manipulated without creating an instance of the class!

Class variables are referenced by the class name itself, as in:
Bicycle.numberOfBicycles, if numberOfBicycles is a static class variable.
This makes it clear that it is a class variable.
Can also refer to static fields with an object reference, as in:
bikeInstance.numberOfBicycles
but this is discouraged because it does not make it clear that they are class
variables, but possibly instance variables.

Static Methods

Static methods can be invoked with the class name, without need for creating an
instance of the class:
ClassName.methodName(args)
Can also refer to static method with an object reference, as in:
instanceName.methodName(args)
but this is discouraged for the same reason given for class variables, it does
not make it clear that it is a class method

Not all combinations of instance and class variables are allowed

Instance methods can access instance variables and methods.
Instance methods can access class (static) variables and methods.
Class (static) methods can access class (static) variables and methods directly.
Class (static) methods cannot access instance variables or methods directly,
    they must use an object reference. Also, class methods cannot use "this"
    keyword as there is no instance for "this" to refer to.

Constants and use of the Final Keyword

Use of the "static" modifier in combination with the "final" modifier is used
to define constants. The final modifier indicates that the value of this
field cannot change.
static final double PI = 3.14159265
Use uppercase, and can include underscore (_). These are "compile-time constants"
and if it is changed in the source all classes that use it will need to be
recompiled.
