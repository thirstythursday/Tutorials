Painting

The paintComponent method is where all of your custom painting takes place.
This method is defined by javax.swing.JComponent and then overridden by your
subclasses to provide their custom behavior. Its sole parameter, a
java.awt.Graphics object, exposes a number of methods for drawing 2D shapes
and obtaining information about the application's graphics environment.

In most cases the object that is actually received by this method will be an
instance of java.awt.Graphics2D (a Graphics subclass), which provides support
for sophisticated 2D graphics rendering.
